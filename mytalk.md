Radovan demonstrate how a simple script can be made more general.
The purpose is to make it more general such that the code produced can find more use.

## Pros and cons with the current lesson

- Pros:
    - Enages participants through the HackMD with suggestions on how to proceed.

- Cons:
    - Engages only parts of the audience.
    - Have anyone else than RB delivered this lesson?

## What other approached have we tried?

- We have a [presentation](https://github.com/coderefinery/modular-code-development/blob/master/talk.md) on modular code development. The presentation is 15-20 minutes long, illustrating different concepts.
- The lesson ends with group work and a plenum discussion on different aspects modular code development.
- This approach have only been used with physical CodeRefinery lesson, with 20-60 attendances.

- Cons:
    - This approach do not scale online

## What other ways to deliver "Modular Code Development"?

- We could let the participants do the code development. The challenge is to present the target in a meaningful way.

- Pros:
    - Will be more engaging?
    - 

- Cons:
    - To challenging task
