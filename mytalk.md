## How it is beeing teached.

Radovan demonstrate how a simple script can be made more general.
The purpose of making it more general is that the script can find more use.

## Pros and cons with the current lesson

- Pros:
    - Enages participants through the HackMD with suggestions on how to proceed.

- Cons:
    - Engages only parts of the audience.
    - Have anyone else than RB do this lesson?

## What other approached have we tried?

- We have a [presentation](https://github.com/coderefinery/modular-code-development/blob/master/talk.md) on modular code development. The presentation is 15-20 minutes long.
- The lesson ends with group work and a plenum discussion on different aspects modular code development (physical CodeRefinery lesson)
